# Adding to the Spring application permissions for simple classes, and for the enum-classes that implement the interface IAccessRole.

An example of the work can be seen in the test class link:src/test/java/sample/ru/itbasis/utils/spring/security/accessrole/CoreAccessRole.java[CoreAccessRole], link:src/test/java/sample/ru/itbasis/utils/spring/security/accessrole/CustomAccessRole.java[CustomAccessRole] and link:src/test/java/sample/ru/itbasis/utils/spring/security/accessrole/entity/TestEntity.java[TestEntity]

## How to work with the kernel

To work just connect the module to implement IAccessRole interface and add an annotation @AccessRole or its derivatives.

## How to work with the module in collaboration with Hibernate

To work just connect the module and configure application Hibernate EntityManager.

Roles are stored in the database in one line with the division of roles names comma to the same column and in the form of separate lines using annotations @ElementCollection

---
In the plans:

1. Add support for annotations @Secured
1. Add the preservation of the entity into a separate database table to be able to bind through the field "id" records
1. Add examples as individual modules
